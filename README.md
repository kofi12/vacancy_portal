# Vacancy Portal

## The Problem
- Social workers are constantly calling/emailing RCF(Residential Care Facility) management in order to find out if there are any vacancies available at the Home
- It can be hard for management to keep track of contacts, they can receive 5-10 calls a day about vacancies
- Also documents need to be gathered when assessing and eventually accepting a potential tenant

## Solution
- I came up with idea to create portal between RCF management and the social workers
- Management can update there current vacancy data
- Social workers can view the vacancy status of the RCF and put potential clients on a waitlist
- They can retrieve and fill any admission documents necessary and upload to the clients file
- Social workers can view RCF management availability and book a viewing for their client
- All this can be done without the need to manually keep track of the progress from inquiring about a vacancy to meeting and accepting a potential tenant

### TODO
- [ ] dive into the tech stack
- [ ] talk about design decisions
- [ ] explain how to run and test the api
